# sqlalchemy-challenge
## Description
Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with your trip planning, you decide to do a climate analysis about the area. The following sections outline the steps that you need to take to accomplish this task.
#### Part 1: 
Analyse and Explore the Climate Data. Precipitation Analysis. Station Analysis. In this section, you’ll use Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. Specifically, you’ll use SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
#### Part 2: 
Design Your Climate App. Now that you’ve completed your initial analysis, you’ll design a Flask API based on the queries that you just developed. To do so, use Flask to create your routes.

## Installation and use
Data source: UWA analystics bootcamp Software: Part one is completed using two CSV files imported to a jupyter source file, run with Python 3 in Jupyter Notebook 6.5.4 and using SQLAlchemy queries and Matplotlib. Part two is completed in Visual Studio Code 1.84.2 using SQlite database to interact with Flask Python to create an app on Chrome.
